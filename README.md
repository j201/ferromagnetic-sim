# Ferromagnetic Simulation

An interactive simulation of an Ising model on a 2D lattice using the [Wolff algorithm](http://csml.northwestern.edu/resources/Reprints/lnp_color.pdf). Implemented in Julia using IJulia/Jupyter. Everything is in ferromagnetic-sim.ipynb.

Other than IJulia, the following Julia libraries are required to run the simulation:

- Interact.jl
- Plots.jl
- Suppressor.jl
